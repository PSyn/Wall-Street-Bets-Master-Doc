The dated data (e.g. 3/10) is representative of the growth rate based on rate of change per day of infections.
The GRate and D(1-9) are examples of rates that are predicted based on actual change of # of infected (these go exponential very quickly and are unreliable)
The CN Rate reflects the rate of increase that is likely to happen if all of the USA followed CN's growth rate

*It's very important to note that from 3/13 to 3/14 and 3/15 # of infections went from linear to exponential.  The actual rate is somehwere between the exponential and linear.

In the USA, testing has been extremely slow and therefore this chart will be updated daily, we should expect to see a jump in infections in the next several days.
