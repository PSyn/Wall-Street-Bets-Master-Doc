1. New Mexico (-1%)

    **Largest industry:** Oil and gas extraction

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $7.7 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 8.9%

    **Industry workforce:** 5,342

    Driven largely by its petroleum resources, New Mexico is the seventh largest
    net producer of energy among all states. Oil and gas production
    contributed $7.7 billion to the state economy in 2015 -- or 8.9% of the
    state’s total GDP. Though falling oil prices have hurt the industry in
    recent years, economic output tied to oil and gas extraction in New
    Mexico expanded by about 25% in 2015.

    Generating $14.2 billion in economic output in 2015, insurance is the largest
    industry in Wisconsin after real estate. Partially due to rising
    insurance coverage rates in the state, largely attributable to the
    Affordable Care Act, insurance has been a boon for the state’s economy,
    expanding by 25.6% over the last five years. Insurance companies
    headquartered in the state include Sentry, American Family Insurance,
    and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance.

3. Oklahoma (-3%)

    **Industry workforce:** 23,868

    Oklahoma is one of only seven states where real estate is not the largest
    industry. Like most other states with the same distinction, Oklahoma is
    resource-rich and heavily dependent on oil and gas extraction. The
    industry accounted for 15.6% of the state’s total economic output. In
    comparison, the largest industry in most states accounts for less than
    6.0% of total GDP. Oklahoma accounted for 7.6% of total natural gas
    production in the United States in 2015, and it ranks in the top five
    oil producing states.

4. Kansas (-6%)

    Spirit AeroSystems Holdings: $9,672.1

    Euronet Worldwide: $7,396.3

    Seaboard: $5,001.5

    **Largest industry:** Ambulatory health care services

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $4.8 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 3.5%

    **Industry workforce:** 110,678

    Producing one-fifth of the country’s wheat, Kansas might be best known for its
    agricultural production, but agriculture is not its largest industry.
    The state's outpatient health care industry is larger. While Kansas
    farms in 2015 accounted for about $3.5 billion in GDP, the state’s
    ambulatory health care services accounted for $4.8 billion. A boon for
    Kansas’s economy, the industry grew by 6.3% in 2015, much faster than
    the state’s overall 2.2% GDP growth that year.

5. Nebraska (-11%)

    Berkshire Hathaway: $493,870.3

    Union Pacific: $120,865.2

    TD Ameritrade Holding: $28,051.5

    Valmont Industries: $2,855.9

    Green Plains: $690.9

    **Largest industry:** Insurance

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $6.8 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 6.8%

    **Industry workforce:** 25,476

    Nebraska’s insurance industry has grown in an explosive way in recent years. In
    2011, the industry generated $4.2 billion in GDP. As of 2015, the
    industry’s contribution to the state economy had increased by over 60%
    to $6.8 billion. Despite being the largest industry in the state,
    Nebraska’s insurance workers are not compensated as well as workers in
    the industry nationwide. The average American insurance worker earns
    $81,146 annually, while the average insurance worker in Nebraska earns
    $64,926 annually.

6. Hawaii (-12%)

    Hawaiian Electric Industries: $4,441.4

    Matson: $1,545.6

    Hawaiian Holdings: $1,271.1

    **Largest industry:** Accommodation

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $3.8 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 5.3%

    **Industry workforce:** 78,342

    Hawaii's economy is highly dependent on tourism. In 2015, a record 8.7 million
    visitors contributed significantly to the accommodations industry's $3.8 billion in economic output that year. This was the largest contribution to state GDP, accounting for 5.3% of Hawaii’s GDP. Though Hawaii’s
    economic output accounts for only half a percentage point of total U.S.
    GDP, its accommodation industry accounts for a disproportionately high
    2.9% of the industry’s nationwide output.

7. South Carolina (-12%)

    Sonoco Products: $6,155.1

    Domtar: $3,124.2

    ScanSource: $920.7

    **Largest industry:** Ambulatory health care services

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $7.1 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 4.0%

    **Industry workforce:** 167,882

    As health insurance coverage increases and the population ages, health
    care is projected to be one of the fastest growing industries in the
    coming years. The largest industry by economic output in South Carolina, ambulatory health care services has been a boon to the state's economy. The industry expanded by 7.5% in 2015, driving the state's total 2.8% GDP growth.

8. Alabama (-12%)

    Company: market cap ($M)

    Vulcan Materials: $15,636.9

    Regions Financial: $14,401.0

    Encompass Health: $5,766.6

    **Largest industry:** Ambulatory health care services

    **Industry GDP contribution:** $8.0 billion

    **Industry output as pct. of GDP:** 4.5%

    **Industry workforce:** 180,952

    Ambulatory health care services counted for about $8.0 billion in economic output
    in Alabama in 2015, more than any other industry. Those with chronic
    conditions are more likely to use outpatient care services such as
    physical therapy, and in Alabama, an estimated 8.4% of state residents
    aged 18-64 are on disability, the second highest share of any state.

9. Louisiana (no data on reservations, but St. Patrick's day images got them infected) 

    Entergy: $18,214.6
